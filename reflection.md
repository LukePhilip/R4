In this image manipulations project, I learned how to create intresting filters on images. I learn simple filters like changing the colors of the image to red, and I have pixelized the image. I also implemented the BLUR filter I read about. It is a simple way of simply blurring the original image. In this project I used functions, variables, conditionals and loops. I used variables to define terms to later refer to them in later funtions. I used functions to create my filters like "redify", "blur", and "pixelize." I used conditionals to create the filter keys, meaning that if a certain key was pressed than a certain filter would be activated. I used for loops in this project to reset the image after the filter.
